# Project Rationale and Technical Overview

## Why I Chose This Project

I selected the Event Discovery & Ticketing Platform because it addresses a real-world need for users to discover, book, and manage event tickets online. This type of application demonstrates a wide range of full-stack skills, including authentication, CRUD operations, API design, and UI/UX best practices. It also provides opportunities to showcase modular architecture and scalable design, which are essential for modern web development.

## Stack and Tools Used

- **Next.js (with App Router):** Modern React framework for SSR, routing, and API routes.
- **React 19:** Latest stable React for building UI components.
- **TypeScript:** Type safety and maintainability.
- **Yarn:** Preferred package manager for speed and reliability.
- **@mui/material & @mui/material-nextjs:** Modern, accessible, and customizable UI components and CSS-in-JS styling.
- **@emotion/react, @emotion/styled, @emotion/cache:** CSS-in-JS styling for MUI and custom components.
- **styled-components & polished:** Alternative CSS-in-JS and utility functions for advanced styling.
- **@fontsource/roboto:** Default font for Material UI.
- **Formik, Yup, Zod:** Form state management and validation.
- **@tanstack/react-query:** Data fetching, caching, and state management for async operations.
- **Axios:** HTTP client for API requests.
- **jsonwebtoken, jwt-decode, bcryptjs, cookies-next:** Authentication, token management, and secure cookies.
- **Lodash, Moment:** Utility functions and date/time handling.
- **Mock Database (`db.json`):** Used for local development and prototyping.
- **Custom Components:** Modular UI built with reusable React components.
- **ESLint & eslint-config-next:** Code quality and consistency.
- **Jest-fetch-mock, node-mocks-http:** Testing utilities for API and HTTP mocking.
- **@types/\*:** TypeScript type definitions for all major libraries.
- **CSS Modules:** Scoped and maintainable styles (in addition to MUI styling).

## Path to Completion

### Features to Add

- **User Profiles:** Allow users to view and edit their profiles.
- **Event Creation/Management:** Enable organizers to create and manage events.
- **Payment Integration:** Add real payment processing (e.g., Stripe).
- **Notifications:** Email or in-app notifications for ticket purchases and event updates.
- **Search & Filters:** Advanced event search and filtering options.
- **Admin Dashboard:** For managing users, events, and orders.

### Scaling and Architecture

**Database:** Replace the mock database with a production-ready solution (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
**Authentication:** Use OAuth or JWT for secure, scalable auth.
**API Layer:** Move to a dedicated backend (Node.js/(Nest) or serverless functions) for complex business logic.
**CI/CD:** Set up automated testing, linting, and deployment pipelines.
**Cloud Hosting:** Deploy on Vercel, AWS, or similar platforms for scalability and reliability.
**Caching & Performance:** Use CDN, caching strategies, and optimize queries for speed.
**UI/UX Design:** Creating and iterating on high-fidelity designs in Figma helps ensure a user-friendly, visually appealing, and consistent interface, which is crucial for user adoption and scalability.

### Final Thoughts

This project is designed to be modular and extensible, making it easy to add new features and scale as user demand grows. The chosen stack is modern, widely supported, and suitable for both rapid prototyping and production deployment.
